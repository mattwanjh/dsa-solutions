## Approach #1: Brute Force

### Intuition

What considerations or key parts of the question should we take into account?

### Algorithm

How can this approach be implemented?

#### Complexity Analysis

Time: $O(n^2)$

Why this time complexity?

Space: $O(n*m)$

Why this space complexity?

## Approach #2: Optimized

### Intuition

What considerations or key parts of the question should we take into account?

### Algorithm

How can this approach be implemented?

#### Complexity Analysis

Time: $O(n)$

Why this time complexity?

Space: $O(m)$

Why this space complexity?

## Test Cases

Any edge cases to consider? Any unknown or tricky behaviour?
